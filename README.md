The end product looks good however there are a few bugs that I couldn't quite figure out. As stated above I need to review getting items from local storage so that I can get the user's scores to show on the screen.

## Summary:
This assignment was extremely challenging for me. Javascript in general is, this assignment was a great gauge for where I am at and where I need to put in more time.
